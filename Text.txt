chemical reactor
trash incinerator/toxic waster disposal
call down plants(planter?)
solar panels

once we have over .25 oxygen, it unlocks the solar panel
oxygenator adds 0.01 oxygen per second per machine
once we have over .25 energy, it unlocks the vaporizer
solar panel adds 0.05 energy per second
vapor uses 0.01 oxygen and 0.01 energy per second

one we have over .25 water .75 energy, it unlocks the incinerator & toxic waste

incinerator uses 0.03 oxygen per second
lowers radiation by 0.01 per second
uses 0.02 energy per second

toxic uses 0.10 energy per second
kills 0.10 radiation per second

once we have 0 rads, the planter is unlocked
planter uses 0.05 water per second
adds 0.10 oxygen per second

time spent at over .75 oxygen will ramp up sky color to blue
time spent at over .75 water and under .25 rads will ramp up the land color to green
